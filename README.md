# DeathTracker (A Celeste Mod)

Keep track of your current and your personal best death counts while playing a chapter!
Comes with an optional feature to restart the chapter when you can no longer beat your PB.

## Display format settings

You can customize the text on the display via the in-game settings / the config file.
(Note that Everest doesn't show text settings when you have a file selected)

Enter any format you like there. Certain values act as placeholders:

`$C` - Deaths of the current attempt
`$B` - Best (lowest death count) clear
`$A` - Total deaths of the current area
`$T` - Total deaths of the save file
